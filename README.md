Bubble Sort: This is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process repeats until the list is sorted.

Selection Sort: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays: one that is already sorted and another one that is unsorted.

Insertion Sort: Insertion sort builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It takes one element from the input data and compares it with the elements in the sorted subarray, moving larger elements one position to the right until the correct position for the new element is found.

Merge Sort: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half independently, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

Quick Sort: Quick sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot, such that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and larger elements are on the right. It then recursively sorts the subarrays.
